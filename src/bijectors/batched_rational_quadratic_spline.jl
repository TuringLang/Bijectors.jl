### Batched rational quadratic spline (RQS) ###
#############################################

# A batched counterpart to `RationalQuadraticSpline` that evaluates many splines over a
# batch of samples with whole-array operations, so the same source runs on `Array` and
# `CuArray` and is differentiable by every AD backend without hand-written rules.
#
# Parameter arrays carry the knot axis first: `(K + 1, D, N)` for `K` bins, `D` transformed
# dimensions, and `N` samples. Inputs are `(D, N)`.

# Constrain raw parameters into a monotone knot grid on `[-B, B]`, batched along dim 1.
# Mirrors the single-sample `RationalQuadraticSpline(widths, heights, derivatives, B)`
# constructor: softmax to positive increments, cumulative sum to knots, scale to `[-B, B]`.

    rqs_params_from_raw(θ_raw::AbstractMatrix, n_dims::Integer, B)

Turn a matrix of raw neural-network outputs into constrained rational-quadratic-spline knot
parameters. `θ_raw` has shape `((3K - 1) * n_dims, N)`, laid out per dimension as `K` width
logits, `K` height logits, then `K - 1` derivative logits.

Returns `(widths, heights, derivatives)`, each `(K + 1, n_dims, N)`, with `widths` and
`heights` monotone on `[-B, B]` and `derivatives` positive with unit endpoints.
