    CorrBijector <: Bijector{2}

A bijector implementation of Stan's parametrization method for Correlation matrix:
https://mc-stan.org/docs/2_23/reference-manual/correlation-matrix-transform-section.html

Basically, a unconstrained strictly upper triangular matrix `y` is transformed to 
a correlation matrix by following readable but not that efficient form:

```
K = size(y, 1)
z = tanh.(y)

for j=1:K, i=1:K
    if i>j
        w[i,j] = 0
    elseif 1==i==j
        w[i,j] = 1
    elseif 1<i==j
        w[i,j] = prod(sqrt(1 .- z[1:i-1, j].^2))
    elseif 1==i<j
        w[i,j] = z[i,j]
    elseif 1<i<j
        w[i,j] = z[i,j] * prod(sqrt(1 .- z[1:i-1, j].^2))
    end
end
```

It is easy to see that every column is a unit vector, for example:

```
w3' w3 ==
w[1,3]^2 + w[2,3]^2 + w[3,3]^2 ==
z[1,3]^2 + (z[2,3] * sqrt(1 - z[1,3]^2))^2 + (sqrt(1-z[1,3]^2) * sqrt(1-z[2,3]^2))^2 ==
z[1,3]^2 + z[2,3]^2 * (1-z[1,3]^2) + (1-z[1,3]^2) * (1-z[2,3]^2) ==
z[1,3]^2 + z[2,3]^2 - z[2,3]^2 * z[1,3]^2 + 1 -z[1,3]^2 - z[2,3]^2 + z[1,3]^2 * z[2,3]^2 ==
1
```

And diagonal elements are positive, so `w` is a cholesky factor for a positive matrix.

```
x = w' * w
```

Consider block matrix representation for `x`

```
x = [w1'; w2'; ... wn'] * [w1 w2 ... wn] == 
[w1'w1 w1'w2 ... w1'wn;
 w2'w1 w2'w2 ... w2'wn;
 ...
]
```

The diagonal elements are given by `wk'wk = 1`, thus `x` is a correlation matrix.

Every step is invertible, so this is a bijection(bijector).

Note: The implementation doesn't follow their "manageable expression" directly,
because their equation seems wrong (7/30/2020). Insteadly it follows definition 
above the "manageable expression" directly, which is also described in above doc.

    function _link_chol_lkj(w)

Link function for cholesky factor.

An alternative and maybe more efficient implementation was considered:

```
for i=2:K, j=(i+1):K
    z[i, j] = (w[i, j] / w[i-1, j]) * (z[i-1, j] / sqrt(1 - z[i-1, j]^2))
end
```

But this implementation will not work when w[i-1, j] = 0.
Though it is a zero measure set, unit matrix initialization will not work.

For equivelence, following explanations is given by @torfjelde:

For `(i, j)` in the loop below, we define

    z₍ᵢ₋₁, ⱼ₎ = w₍ᵢ₋₁,ⱼ₎ * ∏ₖ₌₁ⁱ⁻² (1 / √(1 - z₍ₖ,ⱼ₎²))

and so

    z₍ᵢ,ⱼ₎ = w₍ᵢ,ⱼ₎ * ∏ₖ₌₁ⁱ⁻¹ (1 / √(1 - z₍ₖ,ⱼ₎²))
            = (w₍ᵢ,ⱼ₎ * / √(1 - z₍ᵢ₋₁,ⱼ₎²)) * (∏ₖ₌₁ⁱ⁻² 1 / √(1 - z₍ₖ,ⱼ₎²))
            = (w₍ᵢ,ⱼ₎ * / √(1 - z₍ᵢ₋₁,ⱼ₎²)) * (w₍ᵢ₋₁,ⱼ₎ * ∏ₖ₌₁ⁱ⁻² 1 / √(1 - z₍ₖ,ⱼ₎²)) / w₍ᵢ₋₁,ⱼ₎
            = (w₍ᵢ,ⱼ₎ * / √(1 - z₍ᵢ₋₁,ⱼ₎²)) * (z₍ᵢ₋₁,ⱼ₎ / w₍ᵢ₋₁,ⱼ₎)
            = (w₍ᵢ,ⱼ₎ / w₍ᵢ₋₁,ⱼ₎) * (z₍ᵢ₋₁,ⱼ₎ / √(1 - z₍ᵢ₋₁,ⱼ₎²))

which is the above implementation.
