*A package for transforming distributions, used by [Turing.jl](https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl).*

Bijectors.jl implements both an interface for transforming distributions from Distributions.jl and many transformations needed in this context. This package is used heavily in the probabiistic programing language Turing.jl.
