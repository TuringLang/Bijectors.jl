This package implements a set of functions for transforming constrained random variables (e.g. simplexes, intervals) to Euclidean space. The 3 main functions implemented in this package are the `link`, `invlink` and `logpdf_with_trans` for a number of distributions. The distributions supported are:
1. `RealDistribution`: `Union{Cauchy, Gumbel, Laplace, Logistic, NoncentralT, Normal, NormalCanon, TDist}`,
2. `PositiveDistribution`: `Union{BetaPrime, Chi, Chisq, Erlang, Exponential, FDist, Frechet, Gamma, InverseGamma, InverseGaussian, Kolmogorov, LogNormal, NoncentralChisq, NoncentralF, Rayleigh, Weibull}`,
3. `UnitDistribution`: `Union{Beta, KSOneSided, NoncentralBeta}`,
4. `SimplexDistribution`: `Union{Dirichlet}`,
5. `PDMatDistribution`: `Union{InverseWishart, Wishart}`, and
6. `TransformDistribution`: `Union{T, Truncated{T}} where T<:ContinuousUnivariateDistribution`.

All exported names from the [Distributions.jl](https://github.com/TuringLang/Bijectors.jl) package are reexported from `Bijectors`.

## Functions

1. `link`: maps a sample of a random distribution `dist` from its support to a value in R^n. Example:

```julia
julia> using Bijectors

julia> dist = Beta(2, 2)
Beta{Float64}(Œ±=2.0, Œ≤=2.0)

julia> x = rand(dist)

0.7472542331020509

julia> y = link(dist, x)
1.084021356473311
```

2. `invlink`: the inverse of the `link` function. Example:

```julia
julia> z = invlink(dist, y)
0.6543406780096065

julia> x == z
true
```

3. `logpdf_with_trans`: finds `log` of the (transformed) probability density function of a distribution `dist` at a sample `x`. Example:

```julia
julia> using Bijectors

julia> dist = Dirichlet(2, 3)
Dirichlet{Float64}(alpha=[3.0, 3.0])

julia> x = rand(dist)
2-element Array{Float64,1}:
 0.46094823621110165
 0.5390517637888984

julia> logpdf_with_trans(dist, x, false) # ignoring the transformation
0.6163709733893024

julia> logpdf_with_trans(dist, x, true) # considering the transformation
-0.7760422307471244
```

## `Bijector` interface
Other than the `logpdf_with_trans` methods, the package also provides a more composable interface through the `Bijector` types. Consider for example the one from above with `Beta(2, 2)`.

```julia
julia> using Bijectors; using Bijectors: Logit

julia> dist = Beta(2, 2)
Beta{Float64}(Œ±=2.0, Œ≤=2.0)

julia> x = rand(dist)
0.7173326646959575

julia> b = bijector(dist) # bijection (0, 1) ‚Üí ‚Ñù
Logit{Float64}(0.0, 1.0)

julia> y = b(x)
0.9312689879144197
```

In this case we see that `bijector(d::Distribution)` returns the corresponding constrained-to-unconstrained bijection for `Beta`, which indeed is a `Logit` with `a = 0.0` and `b = 1.0`. The resulting `Logit <: Bijector` has a method `(b::Logit)(x)` defined, allowing us to call it just like any other function. Comparing with the above example, `b(x) == link(dist, x)`. Just to convince ourselves:

```julia
julia> b(x) == link(dist, x)
true
```

What about `invlink`?

```julia
julia> b‚Åª¬π = inv(b)
Inversed{Logit{Float64}}(Logit{Float64}(0.0, 1.0))

julia> b‚Åª¬π(y)
0.7173326646959575

julia> b‚Åª¬π(y) == invlink(dist, y)
true
```

Pretty neat, huh? `Inversed{Logit}` is also a `Bijector` where we've defined `(ib::Inversed{<:Logit})(y)` as the inverse transformation of `(b::Logit)(x)`. Note that it's not always the case that `inv(b) isa Inversed`, e.g. the inverse of `Exp` is simply `Log` so `inv(Exp()) isa Log` is true. Aslo, we can _compose_ bijectors:

```julia
julia> id = (b ‚àò b‚Åª¬π)
Composed{Tuple{Inversed{Logit{Float64}},Logit{Float64}}}((Inversed{Logit{Float64}}(Logit{Float64}(0.0, 1.0)), Logit{Float64}(0.0, 1.0)))

julia> id(y) == y
true
```

This far we've seen that we can replicate the functionality provided by `link` and `invlink`. To replicate `logpdf_with_trans` we instead provide a `TransformedDistribution <: Distribution` implementing the `Distribution` interface from Distributions.jl:

```julia
julia> using Bijectors: TransformedDistribution

julia> td = transformed(dist)
TransformedDistribution{Beta{Float64},Logit{Float64},Univariate}(
dist: Beta{Float64}(Œ±=2.0, Œ≤=2.0)
transform: Logit{Float64}(0.0, 1.0)
)

julia> td isa UnivariateDistribution
true

julia> logpdf(td, y)
-1.0577727579778098

julia> logpdf_with_trans(dist, x, true)
-1.05777275797781
```

When computing `logpdf(td, y)` where `td` is the _transformed_ distribution corresponding to `Beta(2, 2)`, it makes more semantic sense to compute the pdf of the _transformed_ variable `y` rather than using the "un-transformed" variable `x` to do so, as we do in `logpdf_with_trans`. With that being said, we can also do

```julia
julia> logpdf_forward(td, x)
-1.05777275797781
```

At this point we've only shown that we can replicate the existing functionality. But we said `TransformedDistribution isa Distribution`, so we also have `rand`:

```julia
julia> y = rand(td)              # ‚àà ‚Ñù
-0.5231573469209508

julia> x = inv(td.transform)(y)  # transform back to interval [0, 1]
0.37211423725902915
```

This can be quite convenient if you have computations assuming input to be on the real line.

But the real utility of `TransformedDistribution` becomes more apparent when using `transformed(dist, b)` for any bijector `b`. To get the transformed distribution corresponding to the `Beta(2, 2)`, we called `transformed(dist)` before. This is simply an alias for `transformed(dist, bijector(dist))`. Remember `bijector(dist)` returns the constrained-to-constrained bijector for that particular `Distribution`. But we can of course construct a `TransformedDistribution` using different bijectors for the same distribution! It's particular useful in something called _Automatic Derivative Variational Inference (ADVI)_.[2] An important part of this to approximate a constrained distribution, e.g. `Beta`, as follows:
1. Sample `x` from a `Normal` with parameters `Œº` and `œÉ`, i.e. `x ~ Normal(Œº, œÉ)`.
2. Transform `x` to `y` s.t. `y ‚àà support(Beta)`, with the transform being a differentiable bijection with a differentiable inverse (a "bijector")

This then defines a probability density with support same as `Beta`! Of course, it's unlikely that it will be the same, but it's an _approximation_. Creating such a distribution becomes trivial with `Bijector` and `TransformedDistribution`:

```julia
julia> dist = Beta(2, 2)
Beta{Float64}(Œ±=2.0, Œ≤=2.0)

julia> b = bijector(dist)              # (0, 1) ‚Üí ‚Ñù

julia> b‚Åª¬π = inv(b)                    # ‚Ñù ‚Üí (0, 1)
Inversed{Logit{Float64}}(Logit{Float64}(0.0, 1.0))

julia> td = transformed(Normal(), b‚Åª¬π) # x ‚àº ùìù(0, 1) then b(x) ‚àà (0, 1)
TransformedDistribution{Normal{Float64},Inversed{Logit{Float64}},Univariate}(
dist: Normal{Float64}(Œº=0.0, œÉ=1.0)
transform: Inversed{Logit{Float64}}(Logit{Float64}(0.0, 1.0))
)

julia> x = rand(td)                    # ‚àà (0, 1)
0.37786466412061664
```

### Normalizing flows
A very interesting application is that of _normalizing flows_.[1] Usually this is done by sampling from a multivariate normal distribution, and then transforming this to a target distribution using invertible neural networks. Currently there are two such transforms available in Bijectors.jl: `PlanarFlow` and `RadialFlow`. Let's create a flow with a single `PlanarLayer`:

```julia
julia> d = MvNormal(zeros(2), ones(2));

julia> b = PlanarLayer(2)
PlanarLayer{Array{Float64,2},Array{Float64,1}}([1.25544; -0.644276], [0.735741; 0.522381], [-1.19838])

julia> flow = transformed(d, b)
TransformedDistribution{MvNormal{Float64,PDMats.PDiagMat{Float64,Array{Float64,1}},Array{Float64,1}},PlanarLayer{Array{Float64,2},Array{Float64,1}},Multivariate}(
dist: DiagNormal(
dim: 2
Œº: [0.0, 0.0]
Œ£: [1.0 0.0; 0.0 1.0]
)

transform: PlanarLayer{Array{Float64,2},Array{Float64,1}}([1.25544; -0.644276], [0.735741; 0.522381], [-1.19838])
)


julia> flow isa MultivariateDistribution
true
```

That's it. Now we can sample from it using `rand` and compute the `logpdf`, like any other `Distribution`.

```julia
julia> y = rand(flow)
2-element Array{Float64,1}:
 0.8356896540230636 
 0.07708282276548209

julia> logpdf(flow, y)         # uses inverse of `b`; not very efficient for `PlanarFlow` and not 100% accurate
-2.151503833297053

julia> x = rand(flow.dist)
2-element Array{Float64,1}:
 0.8186517293759961 
 0.31896083550211446

julia> logpdf_forward(flow, x) # more efficent and accurate
-2.2489445532797867
```

Want to fit the flow?

```julia
julia> using Tracker

julia> b = PlanarLayer(2, param)                  # construct parameters using `param`
PlanarLayer{TrackedArray{‚Ä¶,Array{Float64,2}},TrackedArray{‚Ä¶,Array{Float64,1}}}([0.100896; -0.753183] (tracked), [0.320337; 0.674077] (tracked), [-1.02852] (tracked))

julia> flow = transformed(d, b)
TransformedDistribution{MvNormal{Float64,PDMats.PDiagMat{Float64,Array{Float64,1}},Array{Float64,1}},PlanarLayer{TrackedArray{‚Ä¶,Array{Float64,2}},TrackedArray{‚Ä¶,Array{Float64,1}}},Multivariate}(
dist: DiagNormal(
dim: 2
Œº: [0.0, 0.0]
Œ£: [1.0 0.0; 0.0 1.0]
)

transform: PlanarLayer{TrackedArray{‚Ä¶,Array{Float64,2}},TrackedArray{‚Ä¶,Array{Float64,1}}}([0.100896; -0.753183] (tracked), [0.320337; 0.674077] (tracked), [-1.02852] (tracked))
)


julia> rand(flow)
Tracked 2-element Array{Float64,1}:
  0.32015420426554175
 -0.9860754227482333 

julia> x = rand(flow.dist)
2-element Array{Float64,1}:
  0.11278529997563423
 -1.6565063910085815 

julia> Tracker.back!(logpdf_forward(flow, x), 1.0) # backprob

julia> Tracker.grad(b.w)
2√ó1 Array{Float64,2}:
 -0.277554258517636  
  0.24043919425701835
```

We can easily create more complex flows by simply doing `PlanarFlow(10) ‚àò PlanarFlow(10) ‚àò RadialFlow(10)` and so on.

In those cases, it might be useful to use Flux.jl's `treelike` to extract the parameters:
```julia
julia> using Flux

julia> @Flux.treelike Composed

julia> @Flux.treelike TransformedDistribution

julia> @Flux.treelike PlanarLayer

julia> Flux.params(flow)
Params([[0.100896; -0.753183] (tracked), [0.320337; 0.674077] (tracked), [-1.02852] (tracked)])
```
Though we might just do this for you in the future, so then all you'll have to do is call `Flux.params`.

Another useful function is the `forward(d::Distribution)` method. It is similar to `forward(b::Bijector)` in the sense that it does a forward pass of the entire process "sample then transform" and returns all the most useful quantities in process using the most efficent computation path.

```julia
julia> x, y, logjac, logpdf_y = forward(flow) # sample + transform and returns all the useful quantities in one pass
(x = [-0.387191, 0.761807], y = [-0.677683, 0.0866711] (tracked), logabsdetjac = -0.07475475048737289 (tracked), logpdf = -2.1282560611425447 (tracked))
```

This method is for example useful when computing quantities such as the _expected lower bound (ELBO)_ between this transformed distribution and some other joint density. If no analytical expression is available, we have to approximate the ELBO by a monte carlo estimate. But one term in the ELBO is the entropy of the base density, which we _do_ know analytically in this case. Using the analytical expression for the entropy and then using a monte carlo estimate for the rest of the terms in the ELBO gives an estimate with lower variance than if we used the monte carlo estimate for the entire expectation.

### TODO Normalizing flows with constrained supports
Requires PR with `Stacked` merged.

### Reference
Most of the methods and types mention below will have docstrings with more elaborate explanation and examples, e.g.
```julia
help?> Bijectors.Composed
  ‚àò(b1::Bijector, b2::Bijector)
  composel(ts::Bijector...)
  composer(ts::Bijector...)

  A Bijector representing composition of bijectors. composel and composer results in a `Composed` for which application occurs from left-to-right and right-to-left, respectively.

  Examples
  ‚â°‚â°‚â°‚â°‚â°‚â°‚â°‚â°‚â°‚â°

  It's important to note that ‚àò does what is expected mathematically, which means that the bijectors are applied to the input right-to-left, e.g. first applying b2 and then b1:

  (b1 ‚àò b2)(x) == b1(b2(x))     # => true

  But in the Composed struct itself, we store the bijectors left-to-right, so that

  cb1 = b1 ‚àò b2                  # => Composed.ts == (b2, b1)
  cb2 = composel(b2, b1)         # => Composed.ts == (b2, b1)
  cb1(x) == cb2(x) == b1(b2(x))  # => true

```
If anything is lacking or not clear in docstrings, feel free to open an issue or PR.

#### Types
The following are the bijectors available:
- Abstract:
  - `Bijector`: super-type of all bijectors. 
  - `ADBijector{AD} <: Bijector`: subtypes of this only require the user to implement `(b::UserBijector)(x)` and `(ib::Inversed{<:UserBijector})(y)`. Automatic differentation will be used to compute the `jacobian(b, x)` and thus `logabsdetjac(b, x).
- Concrete:
  - `Composed`: represents a composition of bijectors.
  - `Identity`: does what it says, i.e. nothing.
  - `Logit`
  - `Exp`
  - `Log`
  - `Scale`: scaling by scalar value, though at the moment only well-defined `logabsdetjac` for univariate. 
  - `Shift`: shifts by a scalar value.
  - `SimplexBijector`: mostly used as the constrained-to-unconstrained bijector for `SimplexDistribution`, e.g. `Dirichlet`.
  - `PlanarLayer`: ¬ß4.1 Eq. (10) in [1]
  - `RadialLayer`: ¬ß4.1 Eq. (14) in [1]

The distribution interface consists of:
- `TransformedDistribution <: Distribution`: implements the `Distribution` interface from Distributions.jl. This means `rand` and `logpdf` are provided at the moment.

#### Methods
The following methods are implemented by all subtypes of `Bijector`, this also includes bijectors such as `Composed`.
- `(b::Bijector)(x)`: implements the transform of the `Bijector`
- `inv(b::Bijector)`: returns the inverse of `b`, i.e. `ib::Bijector` s.t. `(ib ‚àò b)(x) ‚âà x`. In most cases this is `Inversed{<:Bijector}`.
- `logabsdetjac(b::Bijector, x)`: computes log(abs(det(jacobian(b, x)))).
- `forward(b::Bijector, x)`: returns named tuple `(rv=b(x), logabsdetjac=logabsdetjac(b, x))` in the most efficient manner.
- `‚àò`, `composel`, `composer`: convenient and type-safe constructors for `Composed`. `composel(bs...)` composes s.t. the resulting composition is evaluated left-to-right, while `composer(bs...)` is evaluated right-to-left. `‚àò` is right-to-left, as excepted from standard mathematical notation.
- `jacobian(b::Bijector, x)` [OPTIONAL]: returns the jacobian of the transformation. In some cases the analytical jacobian has been implemented for efficiency.

For `TransformedDistribution`, together with default implementations for `Distribution`, we have the following methods:
- `bijector(d::Distribution)`: returns the default constrained-to-unconstrained bijector for `d`
- `transformed(d::Distribution)`, `transformed(d::Distribution, b::Bijector)`: constructs a `TransformedDistribution` from `d` and `b`.
- `logpdf_forward(d::Distribution, x)`, `logpdf_forward(d::Distribution, x, logjac)`: computes the `logpdf(td, td.transform(x))` using the forward pass, which is potentially faster depending on the transform at hand.
- `forward(d::Distribution)`: returns `(x = rand(dist), y = b(x), logabsdetjac = logabsdetjac(b, x), logpdf = logpdf_forward(td, x))` where `b = td.transform`. This combines sampling from base distribution and transforming into one function. The intention is that this entire process should be performed in the most efficient manner, e.g. the `logabsdetjac(b, x)` call might instead be implemented as `- logabsdetjac(inv(b), b(x))` depending on which is most efficient.
